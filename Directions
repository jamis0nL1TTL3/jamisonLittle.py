Functions Reuse Exercise

Write a function named "rect_area" that computes the area of a rectangle. This function will take 2 parameters - length and width.

Write a second function named "rect_surface_area" that calls the first function - "rect_area" - to compute the surface area of a rectangular solid.  This function will take three parameters - length, width and height.

The main program will call the "rect_surface_area" with three parameters length, width and height.

The user input to the program will be three integers - length, width and height of a rectangular solid.

The program will print the length, width and height as input and the surface area of the entire rectangular solid.
